Voice-over.] Our forefather Wei Jin was leaving the western gate of our village, when he saw a figure in the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested. Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison.

2,8,The Chase,Katara,"Are you kidding me?

2,8,The Chase,Iroh,"You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own, without anyone's support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you.

2,9,Bitter Work,Iroh,"Lightning is a pure expression of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire.

2,9,Bitter Work,Iroh,"Oh yeah, good point! I mean, yes. [Outside.] There is energy all around us. The energy is both yin and yang. Positive energy and negative energy.

2,9,Bitter Work,Toph,"This time we're going to try something a little different. Instead of moving a rock, you're going to stop a rock. Get in your horse stance!

2,19,The Guru,Pathik,"[Disappointedly.] Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the basics.

2,19,The Guru,Pathik,"There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck.

2,19,The Guru,Hakoda,"Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed.

3,3,The Painted Lady,Dock,"[Turns his paddle to the right side, pointing at the Fire Nation factory.] Because we're a fishing town. At least that's how it was before the factory moved in.

3,3,The Painted Lady,Sokka,"Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now. [Pulls out his schedule. He stops and looks at the group.

3,3,The Painted Lady,Sokka,"Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory.

[Aang freezes some water to form stepping stones to cross the river.] I know Hei Bai! We're close personal friends! [Katara moves faster, and Aang jumps on a wooden bridge. Katara runs out of the river onto the docks and notices Aang's reflection in the water. She looks up and sees Aang running across a roof.] Heeey! [He suddenly hits a pole, Katara flinches and feels sorry for him but continues on across the river to the other side.

3,3,The Painted Lady,Aang,"Yeah, me too. I hate that. [Looks at Katara's face from behind the veil.] You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit. I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive. [Looks at Katara suspiciously. Tries to look under the hat.]","Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph","Appa, Dock/Xu/Bushi, Jang Hui boy, Momo, Painted Lady","Fire Nation guards, Mung","Fire Nation Army factory, Jang Hui, Jang Hui River"

[Scratches Hawky on the stomach.] Good little messenger hawky. Who's got pretty feathers? [While walking away, he notices a wanted poster he had just past with Toph's picture on it. He gasps in horror and rips it off the wall. Hawky screeches.] You're right, Hawky. This is bad. [Suddenly, the bird poops while standing on Sokka's arm.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"Toph, while I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like. [Pulls out the wanted poster and shows it to her.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"Well it sounds like a sheet of paper, but I guess you're referring to what's on the sheet of paper.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you the Runaway.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"[Happily.] A wanted poster! That's so great! ""The Runaway."" I love my new nickname. Is there a picture of me? Does it look good?","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"[Looks a few times at both the wanted poster and Toph.] Well yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. [Gets back on topic.] But, Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,Don't be such a worrywart like your sister. [Stands up and walks up to Sokka.] Think of it this way: Now you've got plenty of money to help with the invasion plan. [Holds up a bag of money and jiggles it in front of him.],"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"[Ponders for a moment.] Well, that is true. I had this idea of making armor for Appa. [Looks at Appa, who is napping, but opens one eye upon hearing this.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"[Takes some money out of the bag and hands the money to him.] Here's a little extra, so you can get yourself a nice map of the Fire Nation. You know what? [Gives the entire bag to him.] Make it an atlas.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,[While taking the bag.] I do like expensive atlases.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,Of course you do. [Grabs the wanted poster and tucks it into her outfit.] And that's why this wanted poster is going to stay our little secret. [Walks away.],"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,"Sokka, [Places her hand on her face; annoyed.] tell me you didn't buy a bird.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City

3,7,The Runaway,Katara,[Sarcastically.] Well. Look who decided to join us. [Stands up.] Where have you two been? Off scamming again?,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"Yes, we were. [Puts her bag down.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,[Slides to the right to behind Toph.] And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all?,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"No, I don't.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City

3,7,The Runaway,Toph,Yes. Really.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City

3,7,The Runaway,Toph,[Angrily.] Where did you get that!?,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is-,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,You went through my stuff! You had no right!,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,"Your stuff was messy and I was just straightening up, and I happened to stumble across it!","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"That's a lie! [Points at her.] You're lying, Katara!","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,"[Cut to a surprised Katara who glares at Toph. Pushes Toph's pointing hand out of her face.] Fine! It's a lie! But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up! I knew you were hiding something and you were! [Shows her the poster again, but Toph grabs it, tosses it and starts to walk past Katara.] Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you!","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"[Sarcastically.] Oh really, Mom? Or what are you gonna do? Send me to my room?","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,I wish I could!,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"Well you can't! Because you're not my mom, and you're not their mom! [Extends her arm at Aang and Sokka, who are sitting on a ledge.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,I never said I was!,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"No, but you certainly act like it! You think it's your job to boss everyone around, but it's not! You're just a regular kid like the rest of us! So stop acting like you can tell me what to do! I can do whatever I want!","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,"I don't act that way! [Looks at Sokka, who jumps as she says his name.] Sokka, do I act motherly?","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City

3,7,The Runaway,Katara,[Slightly annoyed.] Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk!,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City

3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"Hey, Aang. You wanna test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Aang,Sure. [Leans his head closer to Sokka.],"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"[Talks into Aang's ear.] I'm going to send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Aang,"I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City

3,7,The Runaway,Aang,I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,Yup. We're idiots. [Hawky flies back onto his arm.],"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Aang,I guess Plan B is we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. [Hawky screeches.] Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help. [Walks to Toph.] Come on. We need to talk.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,So lemme guess: You brought me out here to tell me that your sister's not as annoying as I make her out to be.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"Nah, she's pretty much a pain. [Katara, looking up at their feet from below and behind, glares and looks away.] She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business ...","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,Yeah. I don't know how you could deal with it.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"Actually, in a way, I rely on it. [Katara looks back up at them.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,I don't understand.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara? She had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,I guess I never thought about that.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly? I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there. And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture. [Katara, touched by what Sokka says, is reduced to tears.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"The truth is sometimes Katara does act motherly, but that's not always a bad thing. She's compassionate and kind, and she actually cares about me. [Wipes away tears from her left eye.] You know, the real me. That's more than my own mom. [Katara, deeply touched by Toph's words, sinks slightly into the water. Toph punches Sokka in the arm.] Don't ever tell her I said any of this!","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"Hey, my lips are sealed.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,"Hi, Toph. Um, I wanna-","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"[Holds up her hand in a ""stop"" fashion.] Katara, stop. You don't need to apologize. I was the one being stupid. These scams are out of control, and I'm done with them.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,"[Smiles.] Actually I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say ... I wanna pull a scam with you. [Aang and Sokka stare at her from behind, extremely shocked.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,[Also shocked.] What? You wanna pull a scam?,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,"Not just any scam. The ultimate scam. [Sokka and Aang, still staring at her with shock, look at each other and faint, foaming from the mouth slightly. Katara puts her arm around Toph's shoulder, who gives a sly smile.] Whaddaya say, Toph? Just me and you. One last go. You in?","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"[Excited.] You know I'm in! Now what's this idea of yours? [They walk away and leave Aang and Sokka behind, who are now unconscious and foaming at the mouth.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,"The plan is simple: This wanted poster says you're worth a lot of money; Ten times more than you've made in all of your scams. So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way. [As she speaks, the screen fades to the beginning of the episode, where Toph is seen running from the authorities and is caught in a net.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,[Angrily.] How could you do this to me? You betrayed me!,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,[Crosses her arms.] You brought this on yourself. I had no choice. [Turns away from Toph.],"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Town authority,You did the right thing by turning in the Runaway.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,The right thing is its own reward.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Town authority,"Well, I'm happy to hear you say that.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,"[Pauses for a moment.] But, I still want the actual reward.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Town authority,Of course. Right this way.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,Hey! What kind of cell is this?,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Female guard,A wooden one. [She walks away as Toph becomes visibly worried.],"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Town authority,That's her! That's the girl you were looking for!,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Aang,Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long?,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out. [To Hawky and Momo.] You two behave. [Pointing at Appa.] Appa's in charge. [Appa lifts his head as the two animals start screeching at each other as soon as Sokka and Aang leave, but stop as soon as Appa roars at them.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,Wait! It's a trap!,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,"[Sarcastically.] Really? No kidding! Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap?","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"Not for us, Katara! We're the bait! He wants Aang! [Katara's eyes widen with realization.]","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City

3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"But, this was your idea.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,I know. I wanted to show that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"Katara, you are fun. If nothing else, you're at least fun to argue with.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,I know your relationship with your parents is complicated. And I shouldn't have said what I said.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,"It's okay. I was really mad when you said that because ... well because, maybe it's true. [Starts to cry.] I try not to think about it, but when I left, I probably really hurt them.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City

3,7,The Runaway,Aang,"Where do you think anyone is? [The assassin is seen walking across a rooftop behind them. Aang hears him inhaling and becomes shocked when he turns and sees him.] Sokka, watch out!

3,7,The Runaway,Sokka,"You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit.","Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Katara,What are we gonna do?,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City
3,7,The Runaway,Toph,I don't know. I wish we had some earth or water. We need bendables.,"Aang, Appa, Katara, Momo, Sokka, Toph","Dealer, Town authority",Combustion Man,Fire Fountain City

But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world. [To Toph.] I'm sorry for what I did to you.

3,12,The Western Air Temple,Katara,"You might have everyone else here buying your ... transformation, but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past. [Approaches him; threateningly.] So let me tell you something, right now. You make one step backward, [Close-up of Zuko.] one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore.
